            <h2>No One Deserves To Be Hungry</h2>
            <p>There are massive food shortages in the flood affected areas. People are dying due to lack of food. In such sacks we will deliver to them various dried food items such as chira murdi dates and some fruits. We will cook and deliver nutritious food for them when the flood waters recede. </p>

                The floods have washed away many homes, temporary shelters and many other properties. We will do our best to provide a safe place for everyone and clean water for them. We may also take help of various NGOs

            <h2>Every Child Must Be Educated</h2>
            <p>Education is the backbone of the nation. Due to the severity of the flood, studies have been completely stopped in around 600 educational institutions in the greater Sylhet area. There are many students studying in these educational institutions who may never be able to come to the educational institution for education. With your cooperation and our efforts, we will do our best to bring them back to the light of education
